* How to get a release build

Official [[https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode][Build Mode]] shows all the details of each option and meaning, feel free to take a look.

For getting a release build, you got 2 options. But you still need to run =strip= to remove the debug symbol after the release build, just keep that in mind.

** Option 1 - command change only

The ~-Doptimize~ option ONLY exists when you have the default settings in ~build.zig~:

#+BEGIN_SRC zig
  const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{});
#+END_SRC

Otherwise, ~-Doptimize~ won't exists when you run ~zig build~ command!!!


Pick the one you need from the following available release options:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
  zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
  zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
#+END_SRC

You can print those options by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  zig build --help | rg -B3 Release

  # -Doptimize=[enum]            Prioritize performance, safety, or binary size (-O flag)
  #                                Supported Values:
  #                                  Debug
  #                                  ReleaseSafe
  #                                  ReleaseFast
  #                                  ReleaseSmall
#+END_SRC


** Option 2 - ~build.zig~ change needed

*** 1. Set the preferred optimization mode in ~build.zig~ like this:


#+BEGIN_SRC zig
  const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{
      // For best performance
      // .preferred_optimize_mode = std.builtin.OptimizeMode.ReleaseFast

      // For best binary size
      .preferred_optimize_mode = std.builtin.OptimizeMode.ReleaseSmall
  });
#+END_SRC


*** 2. Use ~zig build -Drelease=true~ to enable the relase build

~-Drelease=true~ is only available after adding the above configurations in ~build.zig~!!!
