* Zig tutorial by examples (org version)

This tutorial helps you to learn =Zig= in a quick and easy way. It targets the following audiences:

+ With a system programming language background (C/C++/Rust, etc) and want to try =Zig=

+ Comes from a non-system programming language background and wants to give it a try


I wrote this tutorial as a summary after I use =Zig= to write a few projects (including 2D gaming), so that's why you always see straightforward summarises instead of amazing fancy words in this tutorial. 

Also, you can treat this tutorial as a quick =Q&A= or manual as well. That means you don't need to go through from top to bottom, just click the chapter you're interested in and dive in. In some chapters, I put extra links to other important and valuable blogs/youtube/articles, just in case you want to know more about that topic.

I'm working on some machine learning project with =Zig= at this moment,  I will update this tutorial from time to time, hope it helps:)
